Hi,

This has been nice test. I love this kind of problems so I did enjoy doing them.

So I was running quite short on time when completing this so it's pretty straight forward answers.
If I was doing these solutions at work I would begin with writing failing tests and then solving the problems as per TDD.
This time I just focused on solving the algorithms and skipped testing, so I am relying on luck which is not good but hope it works this time around.

Test no 3 is not refactored proper and other questions also have room for improvements. I wanted to make it more functional, but I suppose
I ran out of time and energy. The solutions seem quite compact so I am fairly pleased with them. Hope it works with your files as well.

I did develope this test with Webstorm so there's webstorm folder in the zip, please ignore it.

Regards,
